What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
- A gitignore file ensures that files ending with the listed extensions are not pushed to the repository, these files and folders aren't tracked by git.
- It should include the environment files related to the IDE, build, basically all the generated files
What does fast-forward in git mean?
- In git, there are multiple ways of merging branches. A user can configure if they want a 3-way merge or a fast-forward merge. 
- In fast-forward, a new merge commit is not created instead the branch pointer is moved from it's previous commit and after fast-forward, 
  it points to the new commit (which is basically the branch that is being merged into).

- We should have different branches so that we can ensure that we don't disturb the main code and we can independently develop features
